# Phase Spaces and Software Complexity

## What is a phase space?
---
A phase space in physics represents all possible values of position and momentum variables in a mechanical system. Then each possible state corresponds to a particular 'point' in the phase space. In other words, a phase space is a representation of all possible values for a particular system.

## What is a software phase space?
---
I'm going to apply the same definition used in the physics representation, except my description will be for software instead of a mechanical system. I'd define a software phase space as the space that is represented by all possible inputs, and outputs for a particular piece of software.

## How is this representation useful?
---
Thinking about software in terms of phase spaces is useful for tuning the complexity/entropy of an application such that it is no more complex than it needs to be.
