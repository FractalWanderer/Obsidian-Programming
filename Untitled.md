The reason I prefer PostSharp is mainly so there isn't a requirement of adding the dependency to the services during startup. With the .NET version, it relies on the MVC framework existing, including the middleware that actually uses the class IActionFilter. To add support in the web api projects, each project would need to add an IActionFilter to their startup, which would probably come from the library, but it's a bit of a pain to have to add that every time.
