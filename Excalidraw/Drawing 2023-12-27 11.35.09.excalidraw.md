# Text Elements
For flood filling a room to determine what the scope of the room is, I think it
makes most sense to do the flood fill calculation, and then overlay tiles for
the room that represent the state of the room.

This way the calculation done by flood fill only needs to happen once, and whenever
the overlay exists we can look to it for the source of truth representing the room. ^SRA2q2Fh
